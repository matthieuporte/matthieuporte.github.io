This is a simple game using minimax and the alpha-beta prunning optimisation.

### How to play 

Simply download the files on my [github](https://github.com/matthieuporte/connect4/) and launch main.py in a terminal with python

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthieuporte/connect4/
cd connect4
python main.py
```

Then choose who's playing against who (you can make the bot play against himself) and choose the difficulty.

Good luck !
