# CountryApp

This is my first React app ! 
I'm following the [fullstackopen course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) and it was one of the exercices.
I made this app thanks [this great API](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/)

The search bar gets updated live which I think is pretty cool.

### How to run it

First things first [clone the repo](https://github.com/matthieuporte/CountryApp)

then at the root of the repo write :
```
npm start
```
then go to localhost:3000
