I made my first website when I was 14. I've done many random things since and I found back some of them. Here they are, the most recent first :

### Portfolios

I really enjoy making portfolios, that's why I've got so many of them : 

+ [First](/archives/portfolio.html)
+ [Second](/archives/portfolio2.html)
+ [Third](/archives/portfolio3.html)
+ [Fourth](/archives/index.html)

### Calculator

My friend Jordan and I decided to see who would do the best calculator in one day, judge for yourself :
[his](/archives/calculette.html) vs [mine](/archives/calculator.html)

### Neuralia.co

My father asked me to redo the website of his company. [Here](/archives/neuralia.html) is what I made.

### InstantPic 

[instant pic](/archives/instantPic.html) was a try on the unsplash API

### Mentalo

[mentalo](/archives/mentalo.html) is a small math game

### Clicker 2

[cliker 2](/archives/clicker2.html) is an idle clicker game, I remember being proud of it, and it must have been better than the first one because I can find it.

### Delirious/Nama

[delirious](/archives/delirious.html) and [nama](http://nama.rf.gd) are probably my very first projects, remember that at the time, simply using a variable was crazy to me !
