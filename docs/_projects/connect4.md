I really enjoy playing connect4, I made one for my calculator back in high school but I donÂ´t know what happened to it, so I did it again, this time implementing a bot to play against ! 

### How to play 

Simply download the files on my [github](https://github.com/matthieuporte/connect4/) and launch main.py in a terminal with python
```
cd address_of_the_repo
python main.py
```

Then choose who's playing against who (you can make the bot play against himself !) and choose the difficulty.

I don't recommend the impossible level since it's taking way too much time to compute the next play.

Enjoy !
